            <h2>Receita</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and lay the noodles flat on a clean surface to prevent sticking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the ground beef or Italian sausage to the skillet. Cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through. Drain any excess grease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the marinara sauce, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange 4 lasagna noodles on top, slightly overlapping. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of the meat sauce, and then a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese on top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!
